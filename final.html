    <h3><strong>types of operating system</strong></h3>
    <img height="250" width="400" src="./types of operating.png" alt="types of operating system">
    <p> <pre>Operating systems can be categorized into different types based on their 

1️⃣ Batch Operating System
    🔹 Jobs are grouped into batches and processed sequentially.
    🔹 Example: IBM OS/360
        
2️⃣ Time-Sharing Operating System
    🔹 Multiple users share system resources simultaneously.
    🔹 Uses CPU scheduling and multitasking.
    🔹 Example: UNIX, Windows Server
        
3️⃣ Distributed Operating System
    🔹 Uses multiple computers connected via a network to share resources.
    🔹 Example: LOCUS, Amoeba
        
4️⃣ Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
    🔹 Used in time-critical applications (military, medical, robots).
    🔹 Types:
      (1) Hard Real-Time OS → No delays (missed deadline = failure).
      (2)Soft Real-Time OS → Delays are acceptable within limits.
    🔹 Example: VxWorks, RTLinux

5️⃣ Network Operating System (NOS)
    🔹 Manages networking, allowing multiple computers to communicate.
    🔹 Example: Microsoft Windows Server, Novell NetWare
        
6️⃣ Mobile Operating System
    🔹 Designed for smartphones and tablets.
    🔹 Example: Android, iOS
